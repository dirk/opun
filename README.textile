h3. Getting Started

# You'll want to grab this repository, which contains both files for a master server and a slave server.
# Either keep them both, or just grab the one you want by copying the folder (master or slave) to its destination.
# Set up your @config.php@ file. Make sure to create a strong password, a good secret (If you're running a slave), and the gateway and base URL.
# Make sure you have @php_value output_buffering "0"@ in your @.htaccess@ file.
# Find a master or a slave to establish your dominion over/become a humble peon for!
